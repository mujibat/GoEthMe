## WILD LIFE GUARDIIAN DAO FLOW

- the contract of the dao is what users who want to create campaings interactt with
- the voting period will have a voting duration
- members of the dao then votes on created caampaigns and decides to approve or not
- if the user that creates the proposal wants his camapin voting period to be sped up he/she pays a fee set by the dao
- the dao has a vault/pool that stores its funds and wil later be shared amogst its members
- if the campaign gets approved, the admin in the dao then makes the campaign go live by creating the campaign on the campaign contract.
- then along side creating the campaign the admin will also deploy a factory contract of an nft for that campaign.
- after the campaign has gone live, for each successfull donation made by the public, the user gets minted an nft once, even if the user donates ten times they get only one nft.

## optional

i think the dao could also support projects that they approve and start by funding it with probably 10% of the campaign goal.
